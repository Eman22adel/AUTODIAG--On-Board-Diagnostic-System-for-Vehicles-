# AUTODIAG (On-Board-Diagnostic-System-for-Vehicles)
# Project Overview:
The On-Board Diagnostic System for Vehicles is designed to identify vehicle malfunctions by analyzing sensory data from various vehicle subsystems. It employs a Python script to stream sensory data from Kaggle through the PL2303 via UART to the STM32f103, which serves as the core of the system. The system utilizes a layered static design architecture with APIs for managing data reception, Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), interrupt handling, memory management, and General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO). Data transmission is achieved through SPI to the ESP8266, which acts as the data gateway, organizing and wirelessly transmitting vehicle data and Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) to the system‚Äôs database via the MQTT protocol periodically.
